# Overview
In this project, I create plots by reproducing a series of plots and use github to fork and clone an existing repository. I then do data analysis using the cleansed tidy data.

The following link empowers you to view a full description of the data used in this project The UCI Machine Learning Repository

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at 
[The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

## Dataset:
Electric power consumption [20mb]

## Description:
Measurements of electric power comsumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.  Different electrical qualities and some sub-metering values and available.

## The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

    1) Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
    2) Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
    3) Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
    4) Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    5) Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
    6) Global_intensity:## household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    7) Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
    8) Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
    9) Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
